Processes individual files to extract documentation and generate output files.This class handles the complete file processing pipeline including documentationextraction, content injection into templates, formatter application, and outputfile generation. It coordinates between various components to transform sourcefiles into formatted documentation.@example```typescriptconst processor = new FileProcessor(config);const result = await processor.preProcess('./src/example.js', target);if ('content' in result) {  await processor.processFile(result, target, 0);}```
