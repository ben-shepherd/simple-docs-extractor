Well-formatted Commit Message Rules

Description:
Ensure commit messages follow standardized best practices.

Rules:
1. Commit message must start with a type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
   followed by a colon and a space.
   Example: feat: add new login feature

2. Commit message subject should be no longer than 72 characters.

3. Subject should be written in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update").
   Use imperative verbs in the subject line.

4. Do not end the subject line with a period.

5. If a body is present, separate the subject from the body with a blank line.

6. Body lines should be wrapped at 72 characters.

7. Each feature should be on a new line prefixed with a dash.
Examples:
- feat: add user authentication module
- fix: resolve crash on startup
- docs: update README with installation instructions
